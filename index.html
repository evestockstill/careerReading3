            <h1 class="c1">What is the mock function?</h1>
            <h2 class="b1">We replace something we do not control with something we do. It allows us features to <ul>
                <li>Capture calls</li>
                <li>Set return values</li>
                <li>Change the implementation</li>

            <h1 class="c1">What is a callback?</h1>
            <h2 class="b2">It is a function passed to another function, when the first function is done the second will run. Problems arise when you begin nesting functions within functions the code is hard to read and may get out of order.</h2>

        <div class="cards" id="c3">
            <h1 class="c1">How can Promises help? What do they do?</h1>
            <h2 class="b3">Using arrow functions we can use the .then() method to un-nest the endless callbacks going in order. It notifies an
            asynchronous operation when it is done. You can use a catch() for an error if something goes wrong</h2>

        <div class="cards" id="c4">
            <h1 class="c1">Async/Await</h1>
            <h2 class="b4">Async declares the function will handle the asynchronous operations and the await is used to specify what we want to
            await. In order to be a await-able function it must have the async keyword or returns a promise</h2>

        <div class="cards" id="c5">
            <h1 class="c1">How is the code stack operating?</h1>
            <h2 class="b5">The JS runtime can only run one line of code at a time. It runs on a single thread operation. The first call in is the last call out. Without any modifications we have to wait for each line of code to finish before moving on to the next.</h2>

            <h1 class="c1">What is the event loop?</h1>
            <h2 class="b6"> 
                <p class="final">The event loop is the cycle of handling events through the call-stack as shown in diagram.
